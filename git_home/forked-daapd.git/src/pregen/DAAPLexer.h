/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.2 debian-7
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : DAAP.g
 *     -                            On : 2015-05-13 11:04:10
 *     -                 for the lexer : DAAPLexerLexer *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise. 
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The lexer DAAPLexer has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef pDAAPLexer, which is returned from a call to DAAPLexerNew().
 *
 * As this is a generated lexer, it is unlikely you will call it 'manually'. However
 * the methods are provided anyway.
 * * The methods in pDAAPLexer are  as follows:
 *
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->QUOTE(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->LPAR(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->RPAR(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->OPAND(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->OPOR(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->NEWLINE(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->STR(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->ESCAPED(pDAAPLexer)
 *  -  void      pDAAPLexer->Tokens(pDAAPLexer)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
