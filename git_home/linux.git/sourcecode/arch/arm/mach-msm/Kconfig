	  Enable support for multimedia drivers using Ion for buffer management
	  instead of pmem. Selecting this may also involve userspace
	  dependencies as well.

config MSM_OCMEM_LOCAL_POWER_CTRL
	bool "OCMEM Local Power Control"
	depends on MSM_OCMEM
	help
	  Enable direct power management of the OCMEM core by the
	  OCMEM driver. By default power management is delegated to
	  the RPM. Selecting this option causes the OCMEM driver to
	  directly handle the various macro power transitions.

config MSM_OCMEM_DEBUG
	bool "OCMEM Debug Support"
	depends on MSM_OCMEM
	help
	  Enable debug options for On-chip Memory (OCMEM) driver.
	  Various debug options include memory, power and latency.
	  Choosing one of these options allows debugging of each
	  individual subsystem separately.

config MSM_OCMEM_NONSECURE
	bool "OCMEM Non Secure Mode"
	depends on MSM_OCMEM_DEBUG
	help
	  Disable OCMEM interaction with secure processor.
	  By default OCMEM is secured and accesses for each master
	  is requested by the OCMEM driver. Selecting this option
	  causes the OCMEM memory to be in non-secure state unless
	  its locked down by the secure processor.

config MSM_OCMEM_POWER_DEBUG

	bool "OCMEM Disable Power Control"
	depends on MSM_OCMEM_DEBUG
	help
	  Disable all OCMEM power management.
	  This keeps all OCMEM macros turned ON at all times thus
	  never allowing them to be turned OFF. Both local power
	  management and RPM assisted power modes are supported.

config MSM_RTB
	bool "Register tracing"
	help
	  Add support for logging different events to a small uncached
	  region. This is designed to aid in debugging reset cases where the
	  caches may not be flushed before the target resets.

config MSM_RTB_SEPARATE_CPUS
	bool "Separate entries for each cpu"
	depends on MSM_RTB
	depends on SMP
	help
	  Under some circumstances, it may be beneficial to give dedicated space
	  for each cpu to log accesses. Selecting this option will log each cpu
	  separately. This will guarantee that the last acesses for each cpu
	  will be logged but there will be fewer entries per cpu

config MSM_EBI_ERP
	bool "External Bus Interface (EBI) error reporting"
	help
	  Say 'Y' here to enable reporting of external bus interface errors to
	  the kernel log. Information such as the offending address and
	  transaction type will be logged. This may be useful for debugging
	  seemingly broken memory accesses.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_CACHE_ERP
	bool "Cache / CPU error reporting"
	depends on ARCH_MSM_KRAIT
	help
	  Say 'Y' here to enable reporting of cache and TLB errors to the kernel
	  log. Enabling this feature can be used as a system debugging technique
	  if cache corruption is suspected. Cache error statistics will also be
	  reported in /proc/cpu/msm_cache_erp.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L1_ERR_PANIC
	bool "Panic on L1 cache errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  To cause the kernel to panic whenever an L1 cache error is detected, say
	  'Y' here. This may be useful as a debugging technique if general system
	  instability is suspected.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L1_RECOV_ERR_PANIC
	bool "Panic on recoverable L1 cache errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP && MSM_L1_ERR_PANIC
	help
	  Certain CPU designs may be able to automatically recover from certain
	  kinds of L1 cache errors, even though the L1 cache itself may not
	  support error correction. These errors should not result in any kind
	  of corruption, but their presence is nevertheless an indication of
	  poor system health. To cause the kernel to panic whenever a
	  recoverable L1 cache error is detected, say 'Y' here. This may be
	  useful as a debugging technique if general system instability is
	  suspected.

	  For production builds, you should definitely say 'N' here.

config MSM_L1_ERR_LOG
	bool "Log CPU ERP events to system memory"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable logging CPU ERP events to an area of memory that will be
	  preserved across a system reset. This may be useful for detecting and
	  troubleshooting ERP-related system crashes in the field.

	  For production builds, you may want to say 'Y' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_PRINT_ACCESS_ERRORS
	bool "Report L2 master port slave/decode errors in kernel log"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Master port errors can occur when a memory request is not properly
	  handled by the destination slave. This can occur if the destination
	  register does not exist or is inaccessible due to security
	  restrictions or (in some cases) clock configuration. Enabling this
	  option will cause a backtrace to be printed to the kernel log whenever
	  such an error is encountered. Note that the error is reported as an
	  interrupt rather than as an exception, meaning that the backtrace may
	  have some skid. This option may help with debugging, though production
	  builds should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_PORT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on L2 master port errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP && MSM_L2_ERP_PRINT_ACCESS_ERRORS
	help
	  Master port errors can occur when a memory request is not properly
	  handled by the destination slave. Enable this option to catch drivers
	  which attempt to access bad areas of the address space, or access
	  hardware registers in an improper state (such as certain clocks not
	  being on). This option may help with debugging, though production
	  builds should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_1BIT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on recoverable L2 soft errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable this option to cause a kernel panic whenever the L2 cache
	  encounters a single-bit (correctable) soft error. This option should
	  only be enabled when doing low-level debugging where cache corruption
	  is suspected.

	  For production builds, you should definitely say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_2BIT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on unrecoverable L2 soft errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable this option to cause a kernel panic whenever the L2 cache
	  encounters a double-bit (non-correctable) soft error. Debug builds
	  will likely benefit from having this option enabled to catch cache
	  problems as soon as possible.

	  For production builds, it may be acceptable to say 'N' here, since
	  an uncorrectable error might not necessarily cause further problems.

config MSM_CPR
	tristate "Use MSM CPR in S/W mode"
	help
	  Enable CPR (core power reduction) in S/W mode, where the processor
	  get's the notification from CPR block and programs the PMIC.

config HAVE_ARCH_HAS_CURRENT_TIMER
	bool

config MSM_CACHE_DUMP
	bool "Cache dumping support"
	help
	  Add infrastructure to dump the L1 and L2 caches to an allocated buffer.
	  This allows for analysis of the caches in case cache corruption is
	  suspected.

config MSM_CACHE_DUMP_ON_PANIC
	bool "Dump caches on panic"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_DUMP
	help
	  By default, the caches are flushed on panic. This means that trying to
	  look at them in a RAM dump will give useless data. Select this if you
	  want to dump the L1 and L2 caches on panic before any flush occurs.
	  If unsure, say N

config MSM_CPU_PWRCTL
	bool "Ensures that krait droop detectors are always off"
	help
	  Droop detector mechanism can adversely affect krait plls during
	  stand alone power collapse operation. Selecting this option
